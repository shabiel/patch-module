 ; The logic under NUM always assigns the original form of PH and PB
 ; values to the stream number, with the ones that now are broken out
 ; under the streams, the code checked for whether the ones under VA
 ; FOIA existed or not, and if not set them to that value.  Well for a
 ; new version, which doesn't have a VA FOIA equivalent, this ended up
 ; setting the VA FOIA to the stream value for the other stream...
 ; So, yes, it needs to be changed.
